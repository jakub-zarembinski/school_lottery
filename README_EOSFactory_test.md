# Unittesting the [School Lottery](https://github.com/cipherzzz/school_lottery)

```md
This file can be executed as a python script: 
'python3 README_EOSFactory_test.md'.

Note, the script relies on its file's position relative to the 'src` directory, 
where is the code of the School Lottery. 
```
<pre>
Here we explain methods of the Tokenika EOSFactory, applicable to the 
development and testing of EOS smart contracts. As the working example, we 
use the <a href="https://github.com/cipherzzz/school_lottery">School Lottery</a>, developed by CipherZ who kindly <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/your-first-eos-dapp-using-eosfactory-aa0394df95d9">reviewed</a> the EOSFactory 
in version 1.1.

Now we are close to the publication of the version 2.0 that is already <a href="https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory">available</a> 
(branch 'dev') in its development form.

<a href="https://rawgit.com/tokenika/eosfactory/dev/docs/build/html/index.html">Here</a> you can find lot of information on this new EOSFactory.

In the current article, we explain a unittest.

```md
Verbosity options:

    * Verbosity.TRACE -- only headdings are printed, while with
    * Verbosity.EOSF -- prints details;
    * Verbosity.OUT -- prints the output from the blockchain;
    * Verbosity.DEBUG -- prints debug info and console output from the 
        blockchain.

KEOSD options:
    * False -- use the NODEOS Wallet Manager;

## Test case

### Automatic translation

```md
The EOSIO accounts are indexed by their names, therefore the names have to be 
unique in the blockchain, and to have the specific format. Then it is not 
possible to grasp any intuitive association between the account name and its 
role specified in the Ricardian Contract. 

For example, if there is in the Contract a notion of an account keeping a
‘school fund 2018’, we can try the name ‘school.fund1’. It is not only far to
a satisfactory name, but it can be taken already.

A natural solution to the problem is to have aliasses to the physical names.
Perhaps, the structure of the native EOSIO account should have a field and
method for this, it is not so now, therefore the EOSFactory uses its own 
system of the named account objects.

For example, the data for a contract action can be stated as in the script code
below. The names involved there are translated to the physical names before 
being sent to the blockchain, and decoded beck when they return in an answer 
from the blockchain.
